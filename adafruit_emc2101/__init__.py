    """Basic driver for the EMC2101 Fan Controller.

    :param ~busio.I2C i2c_bus: The I2C bus the EMC is connected to.

    See :class:`adafruit_emc2101.EMC2101_EXT` for (almost) complete device register set.
    See :class:`adafruit_emc2101.EMC2101_LUT` for the temperature look up table functionality.

    **Quickstart: Importing and using the device**

        Here is an example of using the :class:`EMC2101` class.
        First you will need to import the libraries to use the sensor

        .. code-block:: python

            import board
            from adafruit_emc2101.emc2101_lut import EMC2101_LUT as EMC2101

        Once this is done you can define your `board.I2C` object and define your sensor object

        .. code-block:: python

            i2c = board.I2C()  # uses board.SCL and board.SDA
            emc = EMC2101(i2c)

        Now you have access to the :attr:`manual_fan_speed` attribute to setup the
        desired fanspeed

        .. code-block:: python

            emc.manual_fan_speed = 25


    If you need control over PWM frequency and the controller's built in temperature/speed
    look-up table (LUT), you will need :class:`emc2101_lut.EMC2101_LUT` which extends this
    class to add those features, at the cost of increased memory usage.
